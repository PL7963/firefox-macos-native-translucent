# macOS Native-looking Translucent Tabbar for Firefox (88.0+)

Replaces default Firefox black-and-white theme with a more native-looking light/dark compatible translucent tabbar.
You need to set your theme to "Default" for this tweak to properly work. Works best if you set your system appearance to "Auto" (changing light/dark automatically), then Firefox will follow the OS settings for color scheme.

## How to apply

Please refer to this wonderful guide at [userchrome.org](https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html) for how to set up your own `userChrome.css` file to enable customizations for the Firefox UI.

Once you have a blank (or existing) userChrome.css file in your Firefox profiles folder, copy-and-paste the code included in the `macos-native-tabbar.css` file.
